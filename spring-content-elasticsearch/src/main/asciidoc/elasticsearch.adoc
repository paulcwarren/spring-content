= Fulltext Indexing and Searching with Elasticsearch

== Overview

When enabled, the Elasticsearch integration will, by default, forward all content to an Elasticsearch cluster for fulltext indexing.

== Annotation-based Configuration

Spring Content Elasticsearch requires a `RestHighLevelClient` bean that is used as the connection to your Elasticsearch
cluster.

Elasticsearch can be enabled with the following Java Config.

.Enabling Spring Content Elasticsearch with Java Config
====
[source, java]
----
@Configuration
@EnableElasticsearchFulltextIndexing        <1>
@EnableFilesystemStores                     <2>
public static class ApplicationConfig {

                                            <3>
    public RestHighLevelClient client() {
        return new RestHighLevelClient(RestClient.builder(new HttpHost("localhost", 9200, "http")));
    }

}
----
1. Specify the `@EnableElasticsearchFulltextIndexing` annotation in an `@Configuration` class
2. Spring Content Elasticsearch works with any Spring Content Store module
3. Ensure a `RestHighLevelClient` bean is instantiated somewhere within your `@Configuration`
====

== Spring Boot Configuration

Alternatively, you can use the Spring Boot Starter `spring-content-elasticsearch-boot-starter`.

When using this method of configuration the `@EnableElasticsearchFulltextIndexing` annotation can be omitted as it will
be added for you.  As will a RestHighLevelClient client bean configured to connect to localhost.

The following configuration properties (prefix spring.content.elasticsearch) are supported.

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|=========
| Property | Description
| autoindex | Whether, or not, to enable autoindexing to index content as it is added
|=========

== Making Stores Searchable

With fulltext-indexing enabled, Store interfaces can be made `Searchable`.  See
<<content-repositories.search,Searchable Stores>> for more information on how to do this.

== Custom Indexing

By default when you `@EnableElasticsearchFulltextIndexing` a store event handler is registered that intercepts content
being added to a Store and sends that content to your Elasticsearch cluster for full-text indexing.  This is usually
all you need.  However, sometimes you may need more control over when documents are indexed.  For these cases you can
use the `IndexService` bean directly in your code to index (or unindex) content as required.

When performing custom indexing it is usual to turn of the auto-indexing feature but specifying
`spring.content.elasticsearch.autoindex=false` in your application properties.

== Text Extraction

For images and other media, it also possible to configure the elasticsearch integration to perform text extraction and
send that instead of the image content to Elasticsearch.

This requires two stages of configuration:

1. Add one or more renderers to the application context.  These renderers are used to perform the text extraction.  To be
used for text extraction a renderer *must* produce `text/plain` content but can consume any suitable mimetype.   When
content matching its `consume` mime type is added to a Store the renderer will invoked to extract text and this text
will be sent to the Elasticsearch for fulltext indexing in place of the original content.

@Configuration
@EnableElasticsearchFulltextIndexing
@EnableFilesystemStores
public static class ApplicationConfig {

    public RestHighLevelClient client() {
        return new RestHighLevelClient(RestClient.builder(new HttpHost("localhost", 9200, "http")));
    }
    
    @Bean
    public RenditionProvider jpgTextExtractor() {
        return new RenditionProvider() {
            
            @Override
            public String consumes() {
                return "image/jpg";                     // can be any mime-type
            }

            @Override
            public String[] produces() {
                return new String[] {"text/plain"};     // must be 'text/plain'
            }

            @Override
            public InputStream convert(InputStream fromInputSource, String toMimeType) {
                ...implementation...
            }
        }
    }
