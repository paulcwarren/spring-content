[[content-repositories]]
= Working with Spring Stores

The goal of the Spring Content is to make it easy to create applications that manage content such as documents, images
and video by significantly reducing the amount of boilerplate code that the Developer must create for themselves.  Instead,
the Developer provides interfaces only that declare the intent for the content-related functionality.  Based on these, and on
class-path dependencies, Spring Content is then able to inject storage-specific implementations.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This chapter explains the core concepts and interfaces for Spring Content. The examples in this chapter use Java configuration and code samples for the Spring Content S3 module.  Adapt the Java configuration and the types to be extended to the equivalents for the particular Spring Content module that you are using.
====

[[content-repositories.core-concepts]]
== Core concepts
The central interfaces in the Spring Content are `Store`, `AssociativeStore` and `ContentStore`.  These interfaces
provide access to content streams through the standard Spring Resource API either directly or through association with
Spring Data entities.

[[content-repositories.repository]]
.ContentStore interface
====
[source, java]
----
public interface ContentStore<E, CID extends Serializable> {

	void setContent(E entity, InputStream content); 	<1>

	InputStream getContent(E entity);			<2>

	void unsetContent(E entity);				<3>
}
----
<1> Stores content and associates it with `entity`
<2> Returns the content associated with `entity`
<3> Deletes content and unassociates it from `entity`
====

For example, given an Entity `User`, a `UserRepository` and a `ProfilePictureStore` it is possible to associate and
store a profile picture for each user.

.ContentStore interface
====
[source, java]
----
@Entity
@Data
public class User {
	@Id
	@GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO)
	private Long id;

	private String username;

	@ContentId
	private String contentId;

	@ContentLength
	private Long contentLength
}

public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
}

public interface ProfilePictureStore extends ContentStore<User, String> {
}

@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
	}

	@Bean
	public CommandLineRunner demo(UserRepository repository, ProfilePictureStore store) {
		return (args) -> {
			// create a new user
			User jbauer = new User("jbauer");

			// store profile picture
			store.setContent(jbauer, new FileInputStream("/tmp/jbauer.jpg"));

			// save the user
			repository.save(jbauer);
		};
	}
}

[[content-repositories.multimodule]]
=== Using Stores with Multiple Spring Content Storage Modules

Using a single Spring Content storage module in your application keeps things simple because all Storage beans 
will use to that one Spring Content storage module as their implementation.  Sometimes, applications require 
more than one Spring Content storage module.  In such cases, a store definition must distinguish between storage
 technologies by extending one of the module-specific signature Store interfaces.

See <<signature_types,Signature Types>> for the signature types for the storage modules you are using.

==== Manual Storage Override

Because Spring Content provides an abstraction over storage it is also common to use one storage module for testing but another 
for production.  For these cases it is possible to again include multiple Spring Content storage modules, 
but use generic Store interfaces, rather than signature types, and instead specify the `spring.content.storage.type.default=<storage_module_id>` 
property to manually set the storage implementation to be injected into your Storage beans.

[[content-repositories.events]]
=== Events

Spring Content emits twelve events.  Roughly speaking one for each Store method.  They are:

* BeforeGetResourceEvent

* AfterGetResourceEvent

* BeforeAssociateEvent

* AfterAssociateEvent

* BeforeUnassociateEvent

* AfterUnassociateEvent

* BeforeSetContent

* AfterSetContent

* BeforeGetContent

* AfterGetContent

* BeforeUnsetContent

* AfterUnsetContent

==== Writing an ApplicationListener

If you wish to extend Spring Content's functionality you can subclass the abstract class `AbstractStoreEventListener` and
override the methods that you are interested in.  When these events occur your handlers will be called.

There are two variants of each event handler.  The first takes the entity with with the content is associated and is the
source of the event.  The second takes the event object.  The latter can be useful, especially for events related to Store
methods that return results to the caller.

.Entity-based AbstractContentRepositoryEventListener
====
[source, java]
----
public class ExampleEventListener extends AbstractContentRepositoryEventListener {

	@Override
	public void onAfterSetContent(Object entity) {
		...logic to inspect and handle the entity and it's content after it is stored
	}

	@Override
	public void onBeforeGetContent(BeforeGetContentEvent event) {
		...logic to inspect and handle the entity and it's content before it is fetched
	}
}
----
====

The down-side of this approach is that it does not filter events based on Entity.

==== Writing an Annotated StoreEventHandler

Another approach is to use an annotated handler, which does filter events based on Entity.

To declare a handler, create a POJO and annotate it as `@StoreEventHandler`. This tells
Spring Content that this class needs to be inspected for handler methods.  It
iterates over the class's methods and looks for annotations that correspond to the
event.  There are twelve handler annotations:

* HandleBeforeGetResource

* HandleAfterGetResource

* HandleBeforeAssociate

* HandleAfterAssociate

* HandleBeforeUnassociate

* HandleAfterUnassociate

* HandleBeforeSetContent

* HandleAfterSetContent

* HandleBeforeGetContent

* HandleAfterGetContent

* HandleBeforeUnsetContent

* HandleAfterUnsetContent

.Entity-based annotated event handler
====
[source, java]
----
@StoreEventHandler
public class ExampleAnnotatedEventListener {

	@HandleAfterSetContent
	public void handleAfterSetContent(SopDocument doc) {
		...type-safe handling logic for SopDocument's and their content after it is stored
	}

	@HandleBeforeGetContent
	public void onBeforeGetContent(Product product) {
		...type-safe handling logic for Product's and their content before it is fetched
	}
}
----
====

These handlers will be called only when the event originates from a matching entity.

As with the ApplicationListener event handler in some cases it is useful to handle the event.  For example, when Store
methods returns results to the caller.

.Event-based annotated event handler
====
[source, java]
----
@StoreEventHandler
public class ExampleAnnotatedEventListener {

	@HandleAfterSetContent
	public void handleAfterGetResource(AfterGetResourceEvent event) {
		SopDocument doc = event.getSource();
		Resource resourceToBeReturned = event.getResult();
		...code that manipulates the resource being returned...
	}
}
----
====

To register your event handler, either mark the class with one of Springâ€™s @Component
stereotypes so it can be picked up by @SpringBootApplication or @ComponentScan. Or
declare an instance of your annotated bean in your ApplicationContext.

.Handler registration
====
[source, java]
----
@Configuration
public class ContentStoreConfiguration {

	@Bean
	ExampeAnnotatedEventHandler exampleEventHandler() {
		return new ExampeAnnotatedEventHandler();
	}
}
----
====

[[content-repositories.search]]
=== Searchable Stores
Applications that handle documents and other media usually have search capabilities allowing relevant content to be
found by looking inside of it for keywords or phrases, so called full-text search.

Spring Content is able to support this capability with it's `Searchable<CID>` interface.

.Searchable interface
====
[source, java]
----
public interface Searchable<CID> {

    Iterable<T> search(String queryString);
}
----
====

Any Store interface can be made to extend `Searchable<CID>` in order to extend its capabilities to include the
`search(String queryString)` method.  For example:

[source, java]
----
public interface DocumentContentStore extends ContentStore<Document, UUID>, Searchable<UUID> {
}

...

@Autowired
private DocumentContentStore store;

Iterable<UUID> = store.search("to be or not to be");
----

For `search` to return actual results full-text indexing must be enabled.  See <<fulltext-search,Fulltext Indexing and Searching>>
for more information on how to do this.

[[content-repositories.renditions]]
=== Renderable Stores
Applications that handle files and other media usually also have rendition capabilities allowing content to be transformed
from one format to another.

Content stores can therefore optionally also be given rendition capabilities by extending the `Renderable<E>` interface.

.Renderable interface
====
[source, java]
----
public interface Renderable<E> {

	InputStream getRendition(E entity, String mimeType);
}
----
Returns a `mimeType` rendition of the content associated with `entity`.
====

Renditions must be enabled and renderers provided.  See <<renditions,Renditions>> for more
information on how to do this.

[[content-repositories.creation]]
== Creating Content Store Instances
To use these core concepts:

. Define a Spring Data entity and give it's instances the ability to be associated with content by adding `@ContentId` and `@ContentLength` annotations
+
[source, java]
----
@Entity
public class SopDocument {
	private @Id @GeneratedValue Long id;
	private String title;
	private String[] authors, keywords;

	// Spring Content managed attribute
	private @ContentId UUID contentId;
	private @ContentLength Long contentLen;
}
----

. Define an interface extending Spring Data's `CrudRepository` and type it to the domain and ID classes.
+
[source, java]
----
public interface SopDocumentRepository extends CrudRepository<SopDocument, Long> {
}
----

. Define another interface extending `ContentStore` and type it to the domain and `@ContentId` class.
+
[source, java]
----
public interface SopDocumentContentStore extends ContentStore<SopDocument, UUID> {
}
----

. Optionally, make it extend `Searchable`
+
[source, java]
----
public interface SopDocumentContentStore extends ContentStore<SopDocument, UUID>, Searchable<UUID> {
}
----

. Optionally, make it extend `Renderable`
+
[source, java]
----
public interface SopDocumentContentStore extends ContentStore<SopDocument, UUID>, Renderable<SopDocument> {
}
----
. Set up Spring to create proxy instances for these two interfaces using JavaConfig:
+
[source, java]
----
@EnableJpaRepositories
@EnableS3Stores
class Config {}
----
NOTE: The JPA and S3 namespaces are used in this example.  If you are using the repository and content store abstractions for other databases and stores, you need to change this to the appropriate namespace declaration for your store module.

. Inject the repositories and use them
+
====
[source, java]
----
@Component
public class SomeClass {
	@Autowired private SopDocumentRepository repo;
  	@Autowired private SopDocumentContentStore contentStore;

	public void doSomething() {

		SopDocument doc = new SopDocument();
		doc.setTitle("example");
		contentStore.setContent(doc, new ByteArrayInputStream("some interesting content".getBytes())); # <1>
		doc.save();
		...

		InputStream content = contentStore.getContent(sopDocument);
		...

		List<SopDocument> docs = doc.findAllByContentId(contentStore.findKeyword("interesting"));
		...

	}
}
----
<1> Spring Content will update the `@ContentId` and `@ContentLength` fields
====

== Patterns of Content Association

Content can be associated with a Spring Data Entity in several ways.

=== Entity Association

The simplest, allowing you to associate one Entity with one Resource, is to decorate your Spring Data Entity with the Spring Content attributes.

The following example shows a Resource associated with an Entity `Dvd`.

====
[source, java]
----
@Entity
public class Dvd {
	private @Id @GeneratedValue Long id;
	private String title;

	// Spring Content managed attributes
	private @ContentId UUID contentId;
	private @ContentLength Long contentLen;

	...
}

public interface DvdRepository extends CrudRepository<Dvd, Long> {}

public interface DvdStore extends ContentStore<Dvd, UUID> {}
----
====

=== Property Association

Sometimes you might want to associate multiple different Resources with an Entity.  To do this it is also possible to associate Resources with one or more Entity properties.

The following example shows two Resources associated with a `Dvd` entity.  The first Resource is the Dvd's cover Image and the second is the Dvd's Stream.

====
[source, java]
----
@Entity
public class Dvd {
	private @Id @GeneratedValue Long id;
	private String title;

	@OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
	@JoinColumn(name = "image_id")
	private Image image;

	@OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
	@JoinColumn(name = "stream_id")
	private Stream stream;

	...
}

@Entity
public class Image {
	// Spring Data managed attribute
	private @Id @GeneratedValue Long id;

	@OneToOne
	private Dvd dvd;

	// Spring Content managed attributes
	private @ContentId UUID contentId;
	private @ContentLength Long contentLen;
}

@Entity
public class Stream {
	// Spring Data managed attribute
	private @Id @GeneratedValue Long id;

	@OneToOne
	private Dvd dvd;

	// Spring Content managed attributes
	private @ContentId UUID contentId;
	private @ContentLength Long contentLen;
}

public interface DvdRepository extends CrudRepository<Dvd, Long> {}

public interface ImageStore extends ContentStore<Image, UUID> {}

public interface StreamStore extends ContentStore<Stream, UUID> {}
----
====

Note how the Content attributes are placed on each property object of on the Entity itself.

When using JPA with a relational database these are typically (but not always) also Entity associations.  However when using NoSQL databases like MongoDB that are capable of storing hierarchical data they are true property associations.

==== Property Collection Associations

In addition to associating many different types of Resource with a single Entity.  It is also possible to associate one Entity with many Resources using a `java.util.Collection` property, as the following example shows.

====
[source, java]
----
@Entity
public class Dvd {
	private @Id @GeneratedValue Long id;
	private String title;

	@OneToMany
	@JoinColumn(name = "chapter_id")
	private List<Chapter> chapters;

	...
}

@Entity
public class Chapter {
	// Spring Data managed attribute
	private @Id @GeneratedValue Long id;

	// Spring Content managed attributes
	private @ContentId UUID contentId;
	private @ContentLength Long contentLen;
}

public interface DvdRepository extends CrudRepository<Dvd, Long> {}

public interface ChapterStore extends ContentStore<Chapter, UUID> {}
----
