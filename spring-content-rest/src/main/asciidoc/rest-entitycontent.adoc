== Entity & Content

=== The Collection Resource
Spring Data REST exposes a collection resource named after the uncapitalized, pluralized version of the domain class the exported repository is handling.

Spring Content REST extends this collection resource with a handler that consumes `multipart/form-data`.  This handler allows the creation of an entity
and association of content in a single request.

==== POST
The POST method creates a new entity populating its properties from the form's parameters and associates content from the form's multipart files.

Form parameters may include relationships.

Multipart file names will be used to determine the content property to use in the set content operation.

===== Support Media Types
This POST method supports the `multipart/form-data` media type.
