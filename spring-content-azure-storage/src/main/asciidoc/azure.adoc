= Azure Storage

== Annotation-based Configuration

Spring Content Azure Storage is enabled with the following Java Config.

.Enabling Spring Content Azure using Java Config
====
[source, java]
----
@Configuration
@EnableAzureStorage
public static class ApplicationConfig {

        @Value("#{environment.AZURE_STORAGE_ENDPOINT}")
        private String endpoint;

        @Value("#{environment.AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING}")
        private String connString;

        @Bean
        public BlobServiceClientBuilder storage() {
                return new BlobServiceClientBuilder()
                .endpoint(endpoint)
                .connectionString(connString);
        }
}

== Configuration Properties

The following configuration properties (prefix `spring.content.azure`) are supported.

[cols="3*", options="header"]
|=========
| Property | Required | Description
| bucket | No | Content store location.  If not set as an application property Spring Content Azure Storage will look for  the environment variable `AZURE_STORAGE_BUCKET`

== Accessing Content

=== Storage Model

With Azure Blob Storage, buckets and objects are the two main primitives, where objects are stored in buckets.  Azure has a
flat structure with no hierarchy like you would see in a typical file system.  There are also no limits to the number
of buckets or objects in buckets.  

=== Loading Spring Resources from a Store or AssociativeStore

When a Resource is loaded from the Store the following rules are used to determine the identify the `BlobId` of the
object.

For a `Store`, when a Resource is loaded using a call to `getResource(ID location)`.

- if the Store is typed to a `BlobId` this will be used as-is.
- otherwise, if a registered Spring Converter exists that converts from Store's ID type to a `BlobId` this 
will be used to convert the location (specified in the call to `getResource`) into an instance of `BlobId`
- otherwise, a `BlobId` is created from the default bucket and the location (specified in the call to `getResource`).

For an `AssociativeStore` (or indirectly a `ContentStore`), when a Resource is loaded from a call to `getResource(S entity)`:

- if the store's ID type is typed to a `BlobId` this will be used as-is
- otherwise, if a registered Spring Converter exists that converts the the Store's entity (S) type to a `BlobId` this will be used
to establish an instance of `BlobId`
- otherwise, if one of the Entity's fields is annotated with `@Bucket`, the `@ContentId` and the `@Bucket` will be used as
name and bucket respectively to create an instance of `BlobId`
- otherwise, the `@ContentId` field and default bucket will be used as name and bucket respectively to create an
instance of `BlobId`

See <<configuring_converters,Configuring a Spring Converter>> for more information on how to register a converter.

=== Setting Content using a ContentStore

Storing content is achieved using the `ContentStore.setContent(entity, InputStream)` method.

If content has not yet been stored with this entity and an Id has not been assigned one will be generated
based in `java.util.UUID`.

The `@ContentId` and `@ContentLength` annotations will be updated on `entity`.

If content has previously been stored it will overwritten updating just the @ContentLength attribute, if present.

=== Getting Content from a ContentStore

Content can be accessed using the `ContentStore.getContent(entity)` method.

=== Unsetting Content from a ContentStore

Content can be removed using the `ContentStore.unsetContent(entity)` method.

=== Configuring a Spring Converter
[[configuring_converters]]

To configure Spring Content Azure Storage with one or more Spring Converters that convert your Entities, or IDs, to an
instance of BlobId the following approach can be used:

.Configuring Spring Content Azure Storage with a custom Spring Converter
====
[source, java]
----
@Configuration
public class AzureStoreConfiguration  {

    @Bean
    public AzureStorageConfigurer configurer() {
        return new AzureStorageConfigurer() {

            @Override
            public void configureAzureStorageConverters(ConverterRegistry registry) {
                registry.addConverter(new Converter<TestEntity, BlobId>() {
                    @Override
                    public BlobId convert(TestEntity entity) {
                        return BlobId.of(entity.getCustomBucketField(), entity.getCustomContentIdField());
                    }
                });
            }
        }
    }
}
